## [Introducing Tabpy: Tableau + Python](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/introducing-tabpy-tableau-python-e812bf3f2632)

> *TabPy (the Tableau Python Server) is an Analytics Extension implementation that expands Tableau’s capabilities by allowing users to execute Python scripts and saved functions via Tableau’s table calculations.*

- Some benefits are:
  - Advanced Analytics
  - Machine Learning ready dashboards
  - Advanced Calculations
  - Effective Exploratory Data Analysis


### Installation

- The GitHub repository of TabPy can be cloned and used directly
- other way is using pip or conda.
- TabPy is compatible with Python 3.6 and above.

`pip install tabpy`

### Using Tabpy

- After installation from CLI run the command “tabpy” to connect to the server.

- Now Tabpy server is up for use. We can now connect with tabpy in tableau in Help -> Settings and Performance -> Manage External Service Connection.

- There are two ways that we can use to do Python calculation:
  - Write code directly as Tableau calculated fields. The code then will be immediately executed on the fly in the TabPy server.
  - Deploy a function into the TabPy server that can be reachable as a REST API endpoint.

- Now Tableau is ready to be used with python computation as it is linked with Tabpy. Now it is ready to perform operations on data with Python script.

### Conclusion

You have now successfully integrated Python with Tableau. Next, you can connect to your data and use it for visualization and advanced analytics, storytelling, interactive graphs etc. with TabPy. This integration is a beginning step for a more advanced use case using Tableau and Python.
